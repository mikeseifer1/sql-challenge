Look inside the EmployeeSQL folder and you will find four files.
QuickDBD-Export will show a graphic representation of the tables in the Employee Database.
Employee Table Schemata.sql shows the sql code of how the tables are set up.
Employee Queries show the actual queries created for the assignment.
Employee Analysis1 is a Jupyter notebook showing an analysis of the Employee Data.
